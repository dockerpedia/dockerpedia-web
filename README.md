# Welcome to DockerPedia
DockerPedia is a RDF linked dataset that stored the information about dockers hosted in Docker Hub including 4.5 million of images, its layers and packages. We also provide the vulnerability analysis of these packages obtained with clair. As of this writing we have analyzed 150.000 images and this number is always increasing, creating more that 140 millions of RDF triples that include links to external resources such as the Debian Package Tracking System and The Docker Store.

To explore the data you can follow any of the following links:
